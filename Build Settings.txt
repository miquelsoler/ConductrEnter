Building in AppCode requires:
    Open the project in Xcode
    Go to ConductrEnter target
    Go to Build Settings
    In Architectures select "32-bit Intel (i386)"

Final version should be compiled with Xcode and native architecture. To do so:
    Open the project in Xcode
    Go to ConductrEnter target
    Go to Build Settings
    In Architectures select "Other", remove the current one and manually add $(NATIVE_ARCH)
